This simple python program is a marginally useful way to pull specific astronomical events form the comprehensive astropixels astronomical calendar. The original page is available at astropixels.com for free.

The python program takes a txt file (the astronomical calendar copied over from the Website)
The simple, working version of the program I have right now require the user to input the search term. It must be case sensitive, and exactly the same wording as the terms in the ap calendar.

Future plans: 
1. Make a search term menu that the user can choose from
2. Make the program searchable over multiple years
3. Have the program populate an excel table automatically with the search results.
