This python program is a marginally useful way to pull specific astronomical events form the comprehensive astropixels astronomical calendar. The original page is available at astropixels.com for free.

The python program takes a txt file (the astronomical calendar copied over from the Website)
The simple, working version of the program I have right now require the user to input the search term. It must be case sensitive, and exactly the same wording as the terms in the ap calendar.

# How to use:
1. Download 2019PSTevents.txt and almanaccode.py OR download all files as ZIP (not recommended)
2. Run almanaccode.py (you can double click the file in Windows Explorer)
3. Select reference astronomical calendar txt file, or type Y+Enter to use default 2019 txt file. 
4. Enter desired search term.
4. Profit.

Future plans: 
1. Make a search term menu that the user can choose from
2. Make the program searchable over multiple years
3. Have the program populate an excel table automatically with the search results.
